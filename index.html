<p>
Hello! I’m Pamela Nevins, a web developer with experience as a tax professional and financial services manager, and an economics degree from Boston University. Originally from Quincy, Massachusetts, I have been living in New York City for nearly three years.
<br><br>
Throughout my experiences, I observed the increasing usefulness and importance of technology and began to study programming in my free time. I enjoy finding a problem and using a set of tools from my belt to solve it, whether the tools are the technologies I've learned or the quantitative skills developed during my studies. I have recently completed General Assembly’s web development program, an intensive immersion course, where I learned and applied many technologies including, but not limited to: JavaScript, jQuery, Ruby on Rails, Github, and PostrgreSQL.
<br><br>
Although I spend the majority of my time learning programming, I also enjoy cooking, spending time outdoors, and with my boyfriend and family.
