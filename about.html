  <div class="about">About Me</div>
  <p>
  I, Pamela Nevins, am an aspiring web developer, with experience as a tax professional and financial services manager,
  and an economics degree from Boston University. Originally from Quincy, Massachusetts, I have been living in New York
  City for nearly three years.  You can find the link to view my professional profile <a href = "/index.html">here</a>.
  <br><br>
  Through self-study schedule I have been learning to code for over a year; Java has been my main focus,
  but I have recently joined the Web Development Immersive program at General Assembly and gained familiarity with
  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through my endeavors, not only have I learned about important coding concepts such as
  variables, functions, and loops, but have also firmly determined that programming is the career choice for me and
  the field in which I am eager to gain more experience.
  <br><br>
  Although I spend the majority of my time learning programming, I also enjoy cooking, spending time outdoors, and
  with my boyfriend and family.  Moreover, qualities such as a strong intellect, excellent problem-solving skills,
  and self-motivation help describe my inquisitive personality - this is further evidence why I believe my desire to
  pursue web development is such a good fit.
